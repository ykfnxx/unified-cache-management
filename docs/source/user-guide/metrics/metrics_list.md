No Cache Store-specific Gauges are exported by default.

#### Histograms

| Metric                                        | Description                                                                              |

View the cumulative values at the vLLM `/metrics` endpoint. Use `rate(ucm:on_evict_backend_write_requests_total[5m])` for requests per second and `rate(ucm:on_evict_backend_write_bytes_total[5m])` for bytes per second.

Fake keeps the BlockIds received by `Dump`, so an OnEvictCache local miss can still return a hit for a block previously written to Fake. The existing connector hit-rate metrics therefore reflect the combined OnEvictCache and Fake lookup result.

## 2. Raw Metrics Usage

### 2.1 Hit Rate

Use a layered calculation instead of calculating each Store hit rate independently. First calculate the total hit rate at the boundary of two adjacent cache layers. Then split that total according to the actual load-source ratio reported by those layers. This keeps the numerator and denominator semantics consistent across the hierarchy and provides the most accurate tier-level estimate.

For example, the external-cache hit rate can be calculated from vLLM token Counters:

```text
external_cache_hit_rate = external_hit / external_query
                          * (1 - hbm_hit / hbm_query)
```

For a Cache | Posix pipeline, split the external-cache hit rate using shard Counters:

```text
cache_share = (cache_load_shards - cache_load_wait_shards)
              / cache_load_shards
posix_share = cache_load_wait_shards / cache_load_shards

cache_hit_rate = external_cache_hit_rate * cache_share
posix_hit_rate = external_cache_hit_rate * posix_share
```

Apply the same approach to other layered Stores: calculate their combined hit rate first, then split it using Counters that represent the actual load source. Use `rate()` or `increase()` over the same time range for every Counter in a formula, and do not mix token, block, and shard counts within the same ratio.

### 2.2 Bandwidth

UCM exposes two useful bandwidth views with different meanings:

- The `*_bandwidth_gbps` Histograms record effective bandwidth for individual tasks. They show instantaneous task speed and its distribution, such as p50, p90, and p99, but they do not represent total system throughput.
- Average system bandwidth should be calculated as total transferred bytes divided by elapsed time. It includes concurrency and idle periods, so it represents the overall throughput observed during the selected time range.

Use a cumulative byte Counter for the required Store and transfer direction. For example:

```promql
sum(rate(ucm:cache_load_bytes_total[$__rate_interval])) / 1e9
```

Equivalently, for a fixed time range:

```text
average_bandwidth_GBps = increase(transferred_bytes_total) / elapsed_seconds / 1e9
```

Sum byte rates across workers before converting to GB/s. Keep Load and Dump, or read and write, as separate series. Do not average per-task bandwidth values to estimate system throughput.
